## Goals
The user wants a daily planner to create a schedual, for the app to be accepted it must:
- Display the current day at the top of the calendar
- When the user scrolls down they must be presented with time blocks for standard bussiness hours
- Each timeblock must be colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- When a timeblock is selected the user can enter an event
- The text is saved in local storage so if the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
